# Advanced-Lane-Finder

A more robust lane detection algorithm ready to encounter more realistic scenarios such as major change in lighting conditions, shadows and calculate the vehicle position as well as road curvature. This approach detects curved lanes in a much smoother way using polynomial fitting. The [python code](https://github.com/Charan-14/Adanced-lane-finder/blob/master/advanced_lane_finder.py) is provided as well as the [video outputs](https://github.com/Charan-14/Adanced-lane-finder/tree/master/output_videos).
